"description": "Attackers aligned with the RomCom group exploit the zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR (CVE-2025-8088) by delivering malicious RAR archives through spear-phishing emails. The vulnerability enables hidden files to be silently executed upon extraction. These payloads are masqueraded as job application documents and ultimately deploy backdoors such as SnipBot, RustyClaw, and Mythic Agent to maintain persistent access.",
